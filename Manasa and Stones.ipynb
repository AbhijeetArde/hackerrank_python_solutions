    "Manasa is out on a hike with friends. She finds a trail of stones with numbers on them. She starts following the trail and notices that any two consecutive stones' numbers differ by one of two values. Legend has it that there is a treasure trove at the end of the trail. If Manasa can guess the value of the last stone, the treasure will be hers.\n",

    "For example, assume she finds  stones and their differences are  or . We know she starts with a  stone not included in her count. The permutations of differences for the two stones would be  or . Looking at each scenario, stones might have  or  on them. The last stone might have any of , or  on its face.\n",
